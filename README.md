==============

metadata for comt_1 (ncml, docs, but no netcdf files)

This is the directory of ncml and metadata documents for the first IOOS Coastal Ocean Modeling Testbed (COMT1).  These NcML files are used to turn collections of model output netCDF files into CF and UGRID compliant aggregated datasets.   The NcML in this repo may be useful for others who wish to see how to handle collections of ADCIRC, SELFE or FVCOM output files.
